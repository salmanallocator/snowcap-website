    <p class="intro">We created Snowcap in September 2010 with a very simple goal in mind : to think, implement and deliver high quality websites and web applications.</p>

    Before that, the three of us spent about 10 years in various web and communication agencies. We perfected our skills, met incredible people, worked on challenging projects and had a lot of fun.
    But somehow, we felt there was an opening for something a little bit different.

    Snowcap is the opposite of what you would call a 360° agency. Our offer is solely focused on the technical side of the job : analysis, development and IT.
    We don't have dedicated project or account managers, so when you work with us, you are in a continuous dialogue with the people programming your site. For the other tasks (design, strategy, etc.)
    we work with other experts, in order to provide comprehensive solutions.

    Having such a strict job definition means that we can put all our efforts into it, and offer a high level of quality. It makes innovation easier as well : new tools and technologies can be implemented very
    fast, without having to go through a lenghty decision-making process.

    So if you want to work with specialists, who do only one thing but do it right and play well with others, you might just have found your new agency.

    Don't expect us to deliver what you already have - we would rather hear about the rock-solid, extreme performance web platform you've always wanted.
